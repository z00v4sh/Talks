	- Description: 
		Developers usually have local admin rights this makes them a high-profile target for attackers. In a post-exploitation scenario, I'll demonstrate how to leverage PowerShell as an attacker with the goal of achieving domain admin rights. A non-exhaustive list of topics includes the following:
		- Perform reconnaissance on local machine 
		- Scan the internal network for additional hosts and services
		- Bypass UAC
		- Proof of concept host-based IPS
		- Elevate current user to Domain Admin
